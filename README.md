# Dotfiles
My personal dotfiles and configuration files.

### Usage:
1. Clone repo into a suitable folder: `git clone https://github.com/ngf-davef-devops/Dotfiles ~/src/`
2. Back up your previous dotfiles (just in case).
3. Run the script to make a link of the dotfiles in your home directory: `./Dotfiles/install`.
